        Numbers can be found by substracting the segments from eachother. For example the digit 7 - digit 1 leaves only
        one segment. Similarly, any digit - digit 8 leaves no segment.

        3 - 7 leaves 2 segments,
        2 - 7 leaves 3 segments,
        5 - 7 leaves 3 segments,
        Hence, if the digit's length is 5 and subtracting digit 7 leaves 2 segments, the digit was 3.

        2 - 4 leaves 3 segments,
        5 - 4 leaves 2 segments,
        Hence, if the digit's length is 5 and subtracting digit 4 leaves 3 segments, the digit was 2.
        Otherwise it was 5.

        0 - 7 leaves 3 segments,
        6 - 7 leaves 4 segments,
        9 - 7 leaves 3 segments,
        Hence, if the digit's length is 6 and subtracting digit 7 leaves 4 segments, the digit was 6.

        0 - 4 leaves 3 segments,
        9 - 4 leaves 2 segments,
        Hence, if the digit's length is 6 and substracting digit 4 leaves 3 segments, the digit was 0.
